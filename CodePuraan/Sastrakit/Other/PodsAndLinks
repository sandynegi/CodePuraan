Date based helpful tip
======================
If you can control the format of the dates you are dealing with, choose Unix timestamps if at all possible. Unix timestamps are simply integers which represent how many seconds have passed since the “epoch”, which is simply the common reference date of 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.
You can easily transform this timestamp into an NSDate, as shown below:

- (NSDate*)dateFromUnixTimestamp:(NSTimeInterval)timestamp {
return [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSince1970:timestamp];
}

This is even faster than the C function!
Note that many web APIs return timestamps as milliseconds, since it’s very common for Javascript to eventually consume and process this data. Just be aware that you’ll need to divide the timestamp by 1000 before passing it to the dateFromUnixTimestamp method.
